ibc_memo = "I must politely and firmly question if anyone at Informal or Amulet ran the scripts I provided.  To avoid interruptions to ibc, I am now sending transactions down a dead(ish) channel.  It would be interesting to at this time observe chain B as well, if transactions are being relayed between them.  I'm just one person, so I don't have the capacity to provide all of the instrumentation and such that I'd like give Cosmos teams.  I think the issue goes deeper than the mempool, see Kujira.  I worked extremely hard to provide information to the relevant teams, and the commentary from them was pretty startling.  All of my emails with Amulet are at github.com/somatic-labs/meteorite.  Might be good to be a great deal more restrictive abourt aspects of transactions.  It is now my 11:52AM.  I am doing this because I do not want anyone to be able to.  The goal is NOT to distub people, or users, but instead to simply get this issue resolved.  I think it is unreasonable that this is still possible.  Also I mistakenly used the wrong channel on the first batch of transactions.  Really, I don't think that Amulet or Informal ran my scripts.  Really.  I think that I did everything I reasonably could to report this, over the course of months, and have been retaliated against by many teams for doing so.  I don't think that the patch for this belongs in the relayer, and when it comes to performance, I challenge anyone to identify a more meaningful series of events than p2p storms."
